# Section 1

	- Encryption everywhere for Confidentiality and Integrity

	- Symetric encryption systems: encrypt and decrypt with the same key (NEVER USE IT)

	- Single use key (emails) and multiple use key (the key has to be secure)

	Crypto core:	
	- 1st secret key establishment 
	- 2nd secure comunication

	- Digital signatures
	- Anonymous communication
	- anon digital cash, elections, private auctions...
	- secure multi-party computation

		compute f(x1, x2, x3, x4) 

		insecure: trusted authority
		secure: parties can talk to each other (blockchain)

	Crypto magic
	- Private outsourcing computation
	- zero knowledge (proof of knowledge)
		
		Alice has N = p*q
		Bob has N
		
		proof x


	Crypto steps 
	- Precisely specify threat model 
	- Propose a construction
	- tprove breaking construction solve the problem
